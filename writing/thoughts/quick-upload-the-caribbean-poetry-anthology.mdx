There's a lot of knowledge and writing out there which isn't available online. If this knowledge isn't searchable, our AI chatbots won't be able to replicate it. If a large number of cultures use AI chatbots going forwards, this lack of content, context and AI's broader understanding of the world will cause cultural erosion.

I guess I'd also feel a little better about creating a super-intelligence if at least we gave it some interesting poetry to read.

As such, I've transcribed a few poems I didn't think were online yet - [Caribbean Voices, An Anthology of West Indian Poetry, Selected by John Figueroa: Volume 2, The Blue Horizons](https://jhancock532.github.io/the-blue-horizons/)

A lot of today's work is new creation, rather than conservation. I consider this work of conservation (complete with lovely CSS gradient background and choice of font that matches the original books typesetting) a work of net art in itself, simply because it goes against the cultural norm of the internet being made of millions of self-made individuals and their un-ending streams of novelty content. As net art, I would consider the work of sharing others writing as probably more meaningful and better than any work I'd create myself.
