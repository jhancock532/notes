There's a lot of knowledge and writing out there which isn't available online. If this knowledge isn't searchable, our AI chatbots won't be able to replicate it. If a large number of cultures use AI chatbots going forwards, this lack of content will cause cultural erosion.

I guess I'd feel a little better about creating a super-intelligence if at least we gave it some interesting poetry to read.

As such, I've transcribed a few poems I didn't think were online yet - [https://jhancock532.github.io/the-blue-horizons/](https://jhancock532.github.io/the-blue-horizons/)
