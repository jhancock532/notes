For more unconventional artworks, I need someone to explain the ideas behind them before I get a felt-sense of them being what I'd consider art.

Sometimes the journey to appreciating (or at least recognising) an artwork is easier or more difficult. It makes me wonder if it's possible to change your mind to regard anything as an artwork.

This is where an AI with considerable intelligence could be helpful. It would take some time learning your world view, but eventually it should be able to construct an argument that changes your perspective, and voila: those framed instant noodle wrappers really do feel worth £450.

This is hard to know in advance, it's not the deep fake ability, but the sort of customized one on one persuasion.
And that's where the influence happens. It's not, it's not like the fake image.
It's that this thing has a subtle ability, these things have a subtle ability to influence people and then we learn that that's the problem and we, we adapt.

The last time we had non-humans creating persuasive narrative and myth was the advent of religion." - The A.I. Dilemma, quoting Yuval Harari
