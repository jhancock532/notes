- doesn't run well on Safari at all (graphical glitches)
- horrible performance on Firefox when used at full screen, really intensive power usage
- could make for a nice one-off text wobble effect? Test on Safari!
- doesn't use as much CPU when run in a smaller effect area

Note that you could animate dynamic lighting using an SVG as well (point light and spotlight variations)

### Working with an SVG woodcut art style

Create an SVG image using DALLE-3

"A linocut style black and white woodcut image of a medium size golden retriever dog sleeping in a plain cosy dog bed against a white background, no color and large blocky woodcut strokes"

or use Stable Diffusion 1.5 and the print graphic Lora locally - https://civitai.com/models/34903/print-graphic


Edit the photo with a free photo editor to get rid of any generation mistakes.

Then use Adobe's SVG convertor to make it an SVG

Then use the Neo color editor to adjust the colors (if you want true black and white)

Then use the SVG OMG optimiser to get rid of as much SVG cruft as possible, or use https://vecta.io/nano, which is slightly better at optimizing.
