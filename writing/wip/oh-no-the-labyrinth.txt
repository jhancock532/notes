Thinking is not only a path across a maze, but also a labyrinth - we go on a meandering journey to find a truth, then wander outwards again drawing a cohesive understanding together.

This assumes one definition of a labyrinth - that of a continuous path. This definition has been contested throughout history, some say that the labyrinth is the same as the maze. Fun that the very idea of a labyrinth creates a maze of understanding in itself?
