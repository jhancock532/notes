Sadly Elias's work didn't really resonate with me positively or that strongly; it was ultimately more of a nulling, depressive effect. When I was affected most, I had a gut feeling of the sadness of trash and obsolesce by looking at a collection of broken watch faces amassed on a quarter sphere. I didn't particularly enjoy it.

It was unfair to pair Elias's work beside that of James Cohan's. James used similar materials, but his pieces were much lighter, more compelling constructions - one image of donkeys carrying hay in a market particularly evocative, a beam of still life surrounded by the otherwise abstract, manufactured pieces.

Elias, in comparison to James's single piece large coherent canvases, makes modular block constructions. Building up a work with dozens of brick like boards lends well to the theme of factory construction and globalisation and somehow simultaneously kills any beauty of the artwork. Gazing at a massive wall of permutations, each brick unique but similar, I'm left wondering if I should review each brick in turn, looking at their subtly and variation. So I notice differences in variations without really receiving anything of impart, and get left with a handful of impossible questions that don't help me - were three tiles in this piece deliberately added to the wall upside down, or was that an accident? All credit to Elias, it doesn't feel like it matters.

If there is a the detail that I do appreciate close up, albeit occasionally, it is intricate threading of the wire in wave like flows, coils and roils of energy sprawling gracefully across all of the available surface area of his artworks. I'm not a massive fan as it permeates so much of the work, becomes samey, and can't break past the works modular construction (coil flows are cut off and isolated to their squares). I primarily like this flowing nature because I'm a fan of Van Gogh, and Van Gogh used a similar flowing technique brilliantly, as if how he painted his subjects was with the texture of the scene itself.

I'm sure others will enjoy Elias's work aesthetically, sadly this was not my style.
