When I type something to a bot and wait for it to auto-complete / respond, my mind no longer applies itself to the problem, it shuts off and waits to be told the answer.

([This is much like Amelia Wattenberger's own reflections](https://wattenberger.com/thoughts/boo-chatbots))

Writing directly, there is no answer imminently arriving other than what I consider, so my mind is fully applied to what words come next, and where the essay or story is going as a whole. I have to be in the present moment and aware of what I actually think and feel about the subject, which an AI would otherwise regularly interrupt through suggestions and challenges.

What I value most about writing without AI is seeing a consolidation of my feeling and understanding, and then through edits and revisions, its transformation and refinement. And with any creative act, there's the catharsis of expressing what I wanted to say - I think similar self-expression can also be achieved with AI tools, however I've not experienced it or used these tools skillfully enough to this effect.
