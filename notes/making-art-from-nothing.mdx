For more unconventional artworks, I need someone to explain the ideas behind them before I get a felt-sense of them being what I'd consider art.

Sometimes the journey to appreciating (or at least recognising) an artwork is easier or more difficult. It makes me wonder if it's possible to change your mind to regard anything as an artwork.

This is where an AI with considerable intelligence could be helpful. It would take some time learning your world view, but eventually it should be able to construct an argument that changes your perspective, and voila: those framed instant noodle wrappers really do feel worth Â£450.
